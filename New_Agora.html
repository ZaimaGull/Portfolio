        <h2>New Agora</h2>
        <img src="https://zaimagull.github.io/Portfolio/SchemaBuilderNewAgora.png" alt="New Agora Schema Builder" width="900" height="500">
        <p>New Agora is a real estate agency that manages 500 centers while creating 100 user accounts for
            asset, finance, leasing, marketing, and support teams. The application was built to streamline the leasing process, track opportunities, manage leasing contracts, capture payments, and handle customer service cases.</p>
        <h4>Challenges:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Designing a scalable data model for centers and leasing spaces:</li>
                <ul>- It wasn't easy to understand how the company manages centers and leasing spaces. A center could have multiple rentable spaces, which required keeping track of available and occupied spaces within Salesforce. </ul>
            <li>Automating contract approval process:</li>
                <ul>- Automating the contract approval process was complicated since the leasing approvals were done manually, which led to delays.</ul>
            <li>User security and management:</li>
                <ul>- Users were originally given access that caused compliance risks.</ul>
                <ul>- When users needed support, case assignments were done manually, leading to delays.</ul>
        </ol>
        <h4>Contributions:</h4>
        <ol>
             <li>Automated opportunity tracking system:</li>
                <ul>- Redesigning the data model using custom objects and relationships promoted optimization of SOQL queries.</ul>  
                <ul>- Custom opportunity stages were created to automate stage progression in Salesforce via flow and Apex triggers.</ul> 
            <li>Managing leasing payments</li>
                <ul>- A custom approval flow was built to dynamically route approvals based on lease amount and center locations.</ul>
                <ul>- Scheduled batch jobs were implemented to automatically send reminders for overdue payments and update leasing contract statuses accordingly.</ul>
            <li>Custom reports and dashboards:</li>
                <ul>- Interactive dashboards were created to capture real-time reports on leasing trends, payment collections, and available spaces via indexed SOQL queries.</ul>
            <li>User support and security management:</li>
                <ul>- Sharing rules and role hierarchies were implemented to restrict access accordingly.</ul>
                <ul>- Salesforce queues and assignment rules ensured company users, agents, customers, and financial teams received support based on the priority of the case.</ul>
        </ol>

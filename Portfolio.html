            <h3>Heat Smart Alliance</h3>
            <p>Provide an app that helps residential energy coaches or advocates, and some homeowners, estimate a home's heating requirements (heat load) and assess whether proposed heat pumps have sufficient heating capacity for the home. The app will use information about the home including it's location, usual thermostat settings, and historical energy usage, provided by the resident, to calculate the heating requirements in BTUs/hr. Key outputs will include two graphs, one showing the heating requirement vs. outdoor temperature and another comparing the home with other homes based on floor area. In the future, this app may be extended to provide more information, such an estimate of electricity use by a heat pump, cost of heating with a heat pump vs. fossil fuel and other such features.</p>
